Description: A computationally efficient and statistically rigorous fast 
    Kernel Machine method for multi-kernel analysis. The approach is based on 
    a low-rank approximation to the nuisance effect kernel matrices. The 
    algorithm is applicable to continuous, binary, and survival traits and 
    is implemented using the existing single-kernel analysis software 'SKAT' 
    and 'coxKM'. 'coxKM' can be obtained from 
    <https://github.com/lin-lab/coxKM>.
